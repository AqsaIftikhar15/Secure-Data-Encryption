# 🔒 Secure Data Encryption System

A lightweight and user-friendly data encryption app built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and Python.  
This project allows users to securely store sensitive data using encryption and retrieve it with a password — all in-memory without any external database.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Fernet Encryption** – Securely encrypt and decrypt your data using symmetric key cryptography.
- 🧠 **In-Memory Storage** – All data is stored in Streamlit’s session state; no external files or databases are used.
- 🔑 **Password-Based Access** – Data is only accessible via a hashed password.
- 🚫 **Login Lockout** – Three failed attempts block access until reauthorization is done.
- 🛡️ **Master Password Reset** – Regain access with a master password field.
